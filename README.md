# conditional_gan
There are two python files. Cgan.py use MNIST dataset and the other use tree images I collected.

### Run the bash file and change hyperparameters.

#### Reulsts
The file will have output in Tensorboard.

Run the following code to load tensorboard and visilusize images and loss figures.

%load_ext tensorboard 


%tensorboard --logdir   run_reuslts_folder 

#### Visulize results in tensorboard.
How: use the output folder , then load tensorboard to see images generated by generator and loss curves.
Please make sure you install tensorboard in your running environment. If not, you can directly use Colab to run tensorboard.
You can play with the tensorboard to see the output images at different epoches.
Here is a link with examples to show reuslts by Tensorboard.
